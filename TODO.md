#Process

* Start with a season id
* Get the teams list first
	* Don't upsert teams & match at the same time as done now, as the game.insert will fail if the team isn't inserted yet (pk constraint)
* Find a way to get their *id*
	* The current lfp.getCompetitionTeams doesn't get them, as the links are /club/club-name and not /club/:id
* Once teams are OK, fetch the results round by round


#Teams list
The [ranking page](http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/classement#sai=:seasonid)  seems nice, but it doesn't give the teams ids.
* Do we really need them ? *
